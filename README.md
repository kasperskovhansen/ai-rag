# RAG project

Setup a Python environment with the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

Parse the LaTeX files in the raw_data folder by running the `parse.py` file. The file will parse the LaTeX files and save the parsed data in the data folder.

Run the `custom_model.py` to run the model on the parsed data. The generated vector store index will be saved in the `storage` folder for future use.
